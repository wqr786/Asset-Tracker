1. INSTALLATION
===============
The project is developed on Codeigniter framework(http://www.codeigniter.com)
In order to install this application, you will need a web server supporting
PHP 5 or above, and MySQL 5 or above. For a general setup on Windows, you can
get these bundled as a package with XAMPP (version 1.6+) server installation
which you can get from http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html

Steps for Installation:
1. Copy Asset-Tracker project folder and files in your root folder of web server
(example: C:\htdocs\asset-tracker\)

2. Create a database (usually you can create one through phpmyadmin - example:
http://localhost/phpmyadmin [user: root and default password usually is "root"
or blank])
You may use any name while creating database. Example: asset-tracker

2. Open folder /application/config/database.php and setup the following values
with your database information in the file (these options already exist, you
just have to set the values):
$db['default']['hostname'] = 'localhost';   // host connection information
$db['default']['username'] = 'root';	    // username for database
$db['default']['password'] = 'root';	    // password for database
$db['default']['database'] = 'intranet';    // database name

3. Once done, please import the Database schema (refer to section 2)

4. That's it, you can start using the application. You will need any good
browser like Internet Explorer or Firefox, and simply go to the URL on which
it is installed. Example: http://localhost/foldername
So if you had the foldername as asset-tracker, then URL will be like:
http://localhost/asset-tracker

2. Database Setup
=================
1. For creation of Database, please refer to section 1
2. Open the database through some tool, like phpMyAdmin
3. Select the option of Import, and upload asset-tracker.sql from folder
/schema
